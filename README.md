Digital-Bill-Of-Rights
======================

The USA has not transitioned to the digital age very well.  I believe this is because wording in the Bill of Rights
opens the door for interpretation outside the spirit of the original document.  Because the original wording did not 
take into account digital media or the ability ownership over information housed in servers. 

The purpose of this repository is not to edit code, but instead to edit the Bill of Rights.

We recogonize that these edits will not change the Constitutional Bill of Rights, but movements start as an idea.
That idea gains momentum, and can cause change.  If we desire the fredome that this 
country was founded upon, then we must fight for it.  Not only for ourselves, but for future 
generations that will inherit the legacy of either our inaction
